Hello, creepy person. <!--more-->

... This is the only line that used to be present on this post for, at least two years (2018-08-20). But you know, it's time to change that, because there's no time as now. Or maybe it's because the lockdown has gotten to me finally. I want to write.

In order to revive or rather spark interest back into blogging, I figured it's best to go back to the basics and build it from the ground back up. Thankfully, most of the work was already done by my two years ago self; when things were much better and rather predictable. I always expected to make do with whatever basic structure I built in a week. Plastered Jekyll pages with some HTML/CSS layouts — not that aesthetic (or at all) but enough to get my thoughts across.

But predictable didn't mean that I had content to put out, rather things to think about. Twenty-twenty has been very, very different. At times it seems my brain is rotting but at other instances, I have loads, loads of time to ideate. Like ideate how to ideate.

Okay, elephant in the room right? Coronavirus, COVID-19 — there happy now? The keywords... buzzwords of the year and the cause of— nope, that's all the exposure it gets.

Straight to point. I want to talk about:
1. Why Overwatch is in a good state right now
2. Gaming laptops are a thing
3. I can actually, legitimately die peacefully

... Wait, wait... that line, you don't mean? No way.

How is Overwatch in a good state right now? That's totally untrue. Brigitte too broken, Nano-blade every game and DOUBLE SHIELD!! Yeah, yeah. Let's see about that. Too many paragraphs. You know what's good though? WSL. It stands for Linux Subsystem for Windows. Insane how I can get a lot more work done in just Windows nowadays. By the way, I know. It's the other way around for the abbreviation.
